# Learning Journey Position Optimization

## Problem Identified
There was unused space in the Overview page layout, and the Learning Journey section was positioned at the bottom, leaving gaps in the main content area.

## Solution Implemented
**Moved Learning Journey Summary to the main content grid** to better utilize available space and improve the overall layout flow.

## Changes Made

### Before Layout:
```
📱 Hero Section
📊 Live Status Dashboard
📋 Main Content Grid:
   ├── Left Column (About, Skills, Quick Actions)
   └── Right Column (Activity, Education, Coding)
   
📚 Bottom Section (separate):
   ├── Learning Journey (2 cols)
   └── Quick Info (1 col)
```

### After Layout:
```
📱 Hero Section
📊 Live Status Dashboard  
📋 Main Content Grid:
   ├── Left Column (About, Skills, Quick Actions)
   └── Right Column (Activity, Education, Coding, Learning Journey)
   
📚 Bottom Section (compact):
   └── Quick Info Cards (2 columns responsive)
```

## Specific Changes

### 1. **Moved Learning Journey Up**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Learning Journey in separate bottom section
<section className="pb-12">
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
    <div className="lg:col-span-2">
      <JourneySummary />
    </div>
    // ... quick info
  </div>
</section>

// AFTER: Learning Journey in main content grid
<div className="lg:col-span-2 space-y-6">
  // ... existing right column content
  
  {/* Learning Journey Summary */}
  <div className="mt-6">
    <JourneySummary />
  </div>
</div>
```

### 2. **Optimized Bottom Section**
```typescript
// BEFORE: 3-column grid with Learning Journey
// AFTER: 2-column responsive grid for quick info only
<div className="lg:col-span-3 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
  {/* Compact Certifications */}
  {/* Quick Links */}
</div>
```
